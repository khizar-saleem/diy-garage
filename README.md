## Description

DIY Garage is an app that is meant to rid the world of the fear of getting down and dirty with 
personal vehicles. Why waste money paying someone else to do the job when you can do it yourself?
With some basic tools and the will, you can use DIY Garage to learn how to do important routine
maintenance such as tire rotations, oil changes, transmission flushes and much more. DIY Garage
allows you to keep records of the services that have already been done and when services need to
done again so you can keep your cars running for as long as possible. This app is perfect for
DIY'ers or people who just want an app to keep records of their cars.
